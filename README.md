## 🛠 How to Use

1.  Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/Akhilraj739/Artic_Delta/releases) section.
2.  Install and launch the **Artic Delta** app.
3.  Grant the **"Display over other apps"** permission.
4.  Click **"START FPS METER"**.
5.  When prompted by the system, select the specific game or app you want to monitor for maximum precision.
6.  Reposition the meter as needed and start your game!

## ⚠️ Important Limitation

Artic Delta relies on the **"Single App Recording"** feature for maximum accuracy. 

*   **Requirement**: This feature requires **Android 14 (API Level 34) or higher**.
*   **Device Compatibility**: Currently, this app works best on **Pixel devices, Stock Android, and AOSP-based Custom ROMs** that provide the official "Single App" selection dialog. 

Some manufacturers (such as Samsung, Xiaomi, etc.) may hide this option in their custom system skins, forcing the app to capture the **"Entire Screen."** In Entire Screen mode, the meter will detect all visual updates, including system UI animations and **Refresh rate "Touch Boost" spikes** triggered by your finger input. This is a platform-level limitation of the Android security sandbox for non-root apps on certain proprietary skins.
